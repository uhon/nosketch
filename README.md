# Not Only Sketch - nosketch.com

The super awesome sketching app

This is a prototype demonstrating the project-idea with the working-title "nosketch", which spooked around my head for quite a while now)
It consists of a hexagonal Tile-Viewer and Freehand-Drawer


It has some limitations (especially the performance is quite bad, although optimized) and it shows that paperjs may not be the way to go (at least for the viewer)
Especially on mobile-phones the performance-limitations become obvious.
Probably WebGL is the better approach. If possible in Scala. No programming language inspired me more.

## How to run?

- $ sbt run
